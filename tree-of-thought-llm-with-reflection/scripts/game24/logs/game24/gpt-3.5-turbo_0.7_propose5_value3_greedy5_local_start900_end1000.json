By aiming for an intermediate target of 24, we increase our chances of reaching the final goal of 24. (based on: The attempt started well with the addition and subtraction operations, but the division operation resulted in a value (2.67) that was too far from 24. The intermediate values of 13 and 3 were promising as they were relatively close to the target. Moving forward, we should aim for values closer to 24 to increase our chances of reaching the goal.)",
                    "Next step: Divide 240 by 12 to get closer to 24. (based on: - The multiplication operation of 24 * 10 resulted in a value of 240, which deviated significantly from the target of 24.)"

Since 10 is a factor of 24, we can try multiplying 10 by 3 to get 30, then divide by 8 to reach the target value of 24. This approach utilizes the factors of 24 and aims for the target value more effectively. (based on: The attempt went off track when trying to reach 240 as an intermediate step, which led to a final value of 48, far from the target of 24. The initial step of adding 1 + 2 was a good start, but the multiplication by 4 and 6 resulted in a large value of 24, which made it difficult to reach the target.)",

(based on: The attempt started well with the first two steps reaching 3 and then 24. However, the jump from 24 to 240 was too large and deviated too far from the target value of 24. The subsequent division by 20 resulted in 12, which is closer but still short of the target.)"

(based on: The attempt started well by combining 9 and 6 to get 15, but then deviated with a division operation that led to a value of 12. This diverged too far from the target of 24. The intermediate values of 15 and 12 were promising and closer to the target.)",

This could set up the final step of adding 11 to 13 to reach the target of 24. Prioritize using the number 1 in combination with other numbers to reach the target efficiently. Aim for intermediate targets such as 10 and 11 to progress towards 24. (based on: The attempt started well with the initial operations leading to values close to 24. However, the subtraction of 2 in step 3 resulted in a significant deviation from the target. The subsequent addition in step 4 did not bring the result closer to 24.)"

Therefore, the next operation should be adding -4 and -6 to get 10. Prioritize these numbers and aim for the intermediate target of 20 before reaching 24. (based on: The subtraction operations in the previous attempt led to values that were too far from 24, such as -4 and -6. The addition operation that resulted in 11 was a promising intermediate value. Moving forward, it would be beneficial to aim for values closer to 24.)",

The promising intermediate value was 3 obtained in step 2.)",

A suggested next step could be multiplying 1 and 8 (1 x 8 = 8) or adding 1 and 8 (1 + 8 = 9) to reach intermediate targets that align with reaching 24. (based on: The division operation in the previous attempt resulted in a value far from 24, making it an ineffective choice.

For example, dividing 20 by 10 to get 2, then multiplying by 100 to get 200, and then dividing by 8 could be a potential strategy to reach 24. (based on: The attempt failed because the operations led to values that were too far from 24. The jump from 20 to 100 and then to 2000 was too big to reach the target. Intermediate values like 10 and 100 were promising as they were close to 24. Moving from smaller values to larger ones may not always be the best strategy in this case.)"

Prioritize using the number 3 as a factor of 24. A suggested next step could be subtracting 3 from 21 to get 18, which can be followed by adding 6 to reach 24. Aim for intermediate targets such as 18 before reaching 24. (based on: The attempt began well with the first two steps resulting in values closer to 24. However, the multiplication in step 3 led to a value of 21, which made it challenging to reach 24 with the remaining numbers. The final step of multiplying 21 by 3 was too far from the target value.)"

Then, we could try to combine 27 with one of the remaining numbers to reach 24. Prioritizing the division operation and aiming for an intermediate target of 27 would be a strategic move in the next step. (based on: The attempt started well with the first few steps but went off track when the result of multiplying 15 and 9 was 135, which is significantly far from 24. The intermediate values of 5, 0.8, and 15 were promising as they were relatively close to 24.)",

So, the next operation should be: 15 * 9 = 135. (based on: - The division operation in step 2 resulted in a value (0.8) that was too far from 24.)",

I suggest trying to multiply 6 and 8 together to get 48, then use addition or subtraction to reach 24.
