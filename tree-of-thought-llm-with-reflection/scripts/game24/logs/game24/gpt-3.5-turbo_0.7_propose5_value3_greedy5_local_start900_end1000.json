Multiplying 4 and 9 to get 36 was a good move, as it's close to 24, but adding 9 to 36 resulted in 45, which is also too far from the target. Promising intermediate values were 7 and 36.)"

To get closer to 24, the next step after that could involve division by a number that would bring the result closer to 24, such as 18 or 12. So, the next operation could be to multiply 12 and 36 to get 432. (based on: - The multiplication step of 5 * 12 = 60 led to a value that was too far from 24.)",
                    "Next step: - Since 14 is a promising intermediate value, we should aim to combine the remaining numbers to reach this value and then work towards reaching 24. (based on: - The division operation in step 2 led to a value of 2, which is far from 24.)"
