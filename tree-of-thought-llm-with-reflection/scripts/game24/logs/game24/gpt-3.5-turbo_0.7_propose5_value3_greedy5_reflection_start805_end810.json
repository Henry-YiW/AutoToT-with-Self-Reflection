            "1. The previous attempt failed to reach 24 as the final result was 18.\n2. In the first step, multiplication was used effectively to create a larger number. However, this led to a less optimal path towards 24. Subtraction and division were then used, which resulted in a non-integer value and deviated from the goal.\n3. Mistakes included not prioritizing reaching 24 in each step, using division that led to non-integer values, and not considering alternative operations that could have been more efficient.\n4. For the next attempt, prioritize reaching 24 at each step and avoid operations that lead to non-integer results. Consider using addition and multiplication more strategically to reach 24 efficiently.\n5. Common patterns that can be applied in future puzzles include focusing on integer results, identifying key number pairs for multiplication, and avoiding unnecessary steps that deviate from the end goal. Key factors of 24 like 8 and 3, as well as creating or preserving numbers that lead directly to 24, should be considered."
