The attempt failed because the final result was 15, not reaching 24.\n2. Multiplying 5 by 5 resulted in a number too high to work with effectively.\n3. The subtraction steps reduced the value further away from 24.\n4. Overlooked that **8 * 3 = 24** could have been achieved using 8 and 3 directly.\n5. Next time, consider using **8 and 3** first to reach 24 efficiently.\n6. Focus on creating or preserving numbers that can directly reach the target value.",

Multiplying 4 by 6 efficiently led to the goal.\n3. No mistakes or inefficiencies were present in this attempt.\n4. Using multiplication with factors of 24 directly was a smart choice.\n5. Pattern: Identifying key factor pairs like 4 and 6 can lead to quick solutions in Game24 puzzles.",

Multiplication of 4 and 6 directly led to the goal.\n3. Efficient use of key numbers to reach the target quickly.\n4. No mistakes or inefficiencies in this attempt.\n5. Strategy: Recognize key number pairs that directly multiply to 24 for quick solutions.",

The attempt failed because the final result was 80, far from 24.\n2. Addition and multiplication were used, but not in a manner that led to 24.\n3. Overlooked that **6 * 4 = 24** could be achieved directly.\n4. Next time, focus on efficient number combinations that multiply to 24.\n5. Pattern: Multiplying smaller numbers early may lead to better results.",

The attempt failed as the final result deviated from 24.\n2. The initial addition and multiplication were reasonable.\n3. Subtraction was used inefficiently, resulting in a dead-end.\n4. Overlooked the possibility of using **9 * 3 = 27** from the start.\n5. Next time, prioritize operations that lead towards the goal rather than cyclic calculations.\n6. Pattern: Avoid operations leading to repeated numbers without progress towards 24.",
