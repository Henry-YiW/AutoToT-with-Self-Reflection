Prioritizing the numbers 3 and 4 in the next step could lead to a successful solution. (based on: The multiplication step of 3 * 9 = 27 was a key misstep as it led to a value too far from 24. The addition and subtraction steps of 4 + 5 = 9 and 7 - 3 = 4 were relatively close to the target value. Intermediate values of 9 and 10 were promising as they were closer to 24.
